## What is bullstudio?

bullstudio is a modern, cloud-hosted observability and management dashboard for [BullMQ](https://docs.bullmq.io/) queues. It provides real-time insights into queue health, job states, throughput, and failures—all without managing infrastructure.

## Dashboard Overview

The bullstudio dashboard provides comprehensive visibility into your queue operations:

- **Metric Cards**: Total completed jobs, failed jobs, throughput per hour, failure rate, average processing time, and delay
- **Throughput Chart**: Visualize completed vs failed jobs over time
- **Processing Time Chart**: Monitor average processing time trends
- **Slowest Jobs**: Identify performance bottlenecks
- **Failing Job Types**: Track which job types fail most often
- **Active Alerts**: See triggered alerts at a glance

## How It Works

bullstudio connects to your Redis instance to read BullMQ queue data. Connect directly to any publicly accessible Redis instance with TLS encryption.
