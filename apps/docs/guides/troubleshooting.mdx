---

This guide covers common issues you may encounter when using bullstudio and provides solutions to resolve them.

## Connection Issues

### Cannot connect to Redis

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Connection timeout" icon="clock">
    **Symptoms:**
    - "Connection timeout" error when adding connection
    - Connection status stuck on "Pending"

    **Causes:**
    - Redis not accessible from bullstudio servers
    - Firewall blocking connection
    - Incorrect hostname or port

    **Solutions:**
    1. Verify Redis is running and accessible
    2. Check firewall/security group rules allow inbound traffic on Redis port
    3. Confirm hostname and port are correct
    4. Verify your Redis instance is publicly accessible

    ```bash
    # Test connectivity from your network
    redis-cli -h your-redis-host -p 6379 ping
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Authentication failed" icon="key">
    **Symptoms:**
    - "NOAUTH" or "Authentication required" error
    - "Wrong password" error

    **Causes:**
    - Incorrect password
    - Wrong username for ACL auth
    - User lacks required permissions

    **Solutions:**
    1. Double-check the password
    2. For Redis 6+, ensure correct username is provided
    3. Verify user has read permissions on the queue keys

    ```redis
    # Check if authentication works
    AUTH your-password
    # Or for ACL
    AUTH username password
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="TLS handshake failed" icon="lock">
    **Symptoms:**
    - "TLS handshake error"
    - "Certificate verification failed"

    **Causes:**
    - TLS not enabled on Redis
    - Self-signed certificate not provided
    - Wrong port (some providers use different TLS ports)

    **Solutions:**
    1. Confirm TLS is enabled on your Redis instance
    2. For self-signed certs, add CA certificate to connection config
    3. Try port 6380 if 6379 doesn't work with TLS
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Connection status shows Failed" icon="circle-xmark">
    **Symptoms:**
    - Connection shows "Failed" status
    - Error message in connection details

    **Solutions:**
    1. Check the error message in connection details
    2. Use "Test Connection" to diagnose
    3. Review Redis server logs for more details
    4. Verify Redis server is healthy
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## Queue and Job Issues

### No Queues Appearing

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="No queues found after connecting" icon="inbox">
    **Symptoms:**
    - Connection shows "Connected" but no queues appear
    - Queue list is empty

    **Causes:**
    - Connected to wrong Redis database
    - No BullMQ queues exist yet
    - Queues use custom prefix

    **Solutions:**
    1. Verify the database number (default is 0)
    2. Confirm queues exist in Redis
    3. Check if your BullMQ queues use a non-default prefix

    ```bash
    # Check for BullMQ keys in Redis
    redis-cli keys "bull:*"
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Some queues missing" icon="list">
    **Symptoms:**
    - Only some queues appear
    - New queues don't show up

    **Causes:**
    - Queues created after initial connection
    - Different Redis databases
    - Queue prefix mismatch

    **Solutions:**
    1. Refresh the queue list
    2. Check if queues are in different databases
    3. Wait for queue discovery (happens on next activity)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Job Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Jobs stuck in active state" icon="spinner">
    **Symptoms:**
    - Jobs show "Active" for extended periods
    - Active job count keeps growing

    **Causes:**
    - Worker crashed during processing
    - Job is genuinely long-running
    - Worker stalled

    **Solutions:**
    1. Check worker logs for crashes
    2. Configure stalled job handling in BullMQ
    3. Review job processing logic for hanging operations

    ```javascript
    // Configure stalled job check in BullMQ
    const worker = new Worker('queue', processor, {
      stalledInterval: 30000, // Check every 30 seconds
    });
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Jobs failing repeatedly" icon="rotate">
    **Symptoms:**
    - Same jobs failing multiple times
    - High attempt counts

    **Causes:**
    - Bug in job processor
    - External service down
    - Invalid job data

    **Solutions:**
    1. Check job error messages and stack traces
    2. Review job data for issues
    3. Verify external services are accessible
    4. Fix bugs and deploy updated worker code
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't retry or remove jobs" icon="ban">
    **Symptoms:**
    - Retry/Remove buttons don't work
    - "Read-only" error

    **Causes:**
    - Connection is in Read-Only mode
    - Insufficient permissions

    **Solutions:**
    1. Update connection to Read-Write mode
    2. Verify Redis user has write permissions
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Dashboard and Metrics Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Metrics not updating" icon="chart-line">
    **Symptoms:**
    - Dashboard shows stale data
    - "Last updated" timestamp old

    **Causes:**

    - Browser caching
    - Agent disconnected (for proxy connections)

    **Solutions:**
    1. Click the refresh button
    2. Check connection status
    3. Hard refresh the browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
    4. Verify agent is running (for proxy connections)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Charts showing no data" icon="chart-bar">
    **Symptoms:**
    - Charts are empty
    - "No data" message

    **Causes:**

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Alert not triggering" icon="bell-slash">
    **Symptoms:**
    - Metrics exceed threshold but no alert
    - Alert status stays "OK"

    **Causes:**

    2. Check threshold against actual metrics
    3. Wait for time window to complete
    4. Review alert configuration
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Too many alert notifications" icon="bell">
