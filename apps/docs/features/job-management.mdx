The Jobs page lets you browse, search, and manage individual jobs across all your queues. Investigate failures, retry jobs, and view detailed job information.

## Job Browser

The job browser displays jobs in a table with filtering and sorting options.

### Job Information

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **ID** | Unique job identifier |
| **Name** | Job type/name |
| **Queue** | Which queue the job belongs to |
| **Status** | Current job state |
| **Created** | When the job was added to the queue |
| **Processed** | When the job started processing |
| **Finished** | When the job completed or failed |
| **Progress** | Job progress percentage (if reported) |

## Filtering Jobs

### By Status

Filter jobs by their current state using the status tabs:

| Status | Description |

| **All** | Show all jobs |
| **Waiting** | Jobs ready to be processed |
| **Active** | Jobs currently being processed |
| **Completed** | Successfully finished jobs |
| **Failed** | Jobs that threw errors |
| **Delayed** | Jobs scheduled for later |

### By Queue

Use the queue dropdown to filter jobs from a specific queue:

- **All Queues**: Show jobs from all queues
- **Specific Queue**: Show jobs from selected queue only

### By Name

Search for jobs by name/type:

1. Enter the job name in the search field
2. Results filter in real-time

<Tip>
  Use name filtering to find all instances of a specific job type when debugging issues.
</Tip>

## Sorting

Sort jobs by different criteria:

| Sort Option | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Timestamp** | When the job was created (default) |
| **Processed On** | When processing started |
| **Finished On** | When the job completed |
| **Progress** | Job progress percentage |

Toggle between ascending and descending order.

```
Error: Connection refused to payment gateway
    at PaymentService.charge (/app/services/payment.js:45:11)
    at processJob (/app/workers/orders.js:23:5)
    at Worker.processJob (/node_modules/bullmq/...)
```

## Job Actions

### Retry Job

Retry a failed job to process it again:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the failed job">
    Filter by **Failed** status to see failed jobs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open job details">
    Click on the job to view its details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Retry">
    Click the **Retry** button. The job will be moved back to the waiting state.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Retrying a job will process it again with the same data. Ensure the underlying issue is resolved first.
</Warning>

**When to retry:**
- Transient errors (network timeouts, service unavailable)
- After fixing a bug in the worker code
- After resolving external service issues

### Remove Job

Permanently delete a job from the queue:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select the job">
    Click on the job you want to remove.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Remove">
    Click the **Remove** button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    Confirm the deletion. This action cannot be undone.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Removing a job is permanent. The job data will be lost and cannot be recovered.
</Warning>

**When to remove:**
- Test jobs that shouldn't be processed
- Duplicate jobs
- Jobs with invalid data that will never succeed

## Bulk Operations

For managing multiple jobs, consider using:

- Status filters to view groups of jobs
- The BullMQ API directly for bulk operations
- Queue-level operations (pause/resume) for broader control

## Pagination

Jobs are paginated for performance:

- Default: 100 jobs per page
- Navigate between pages with pagination controls
- Total count shown for filtered results

## Access Modes

Job operations depend on your connection's access mode:

| Operation | Read-Write | Read-Only |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| View jobs | Yes | Yes |
| View job details | Yes | Yes |
| Retry job | Yes | No |
| Remove job | Yes | No |

## Best Practices

### Debugging Failed Jobs

1. Filter by **Failed** status
2. Sort by **Finished On** (newest first)
3. Open the job to view the stack trace
4. Check the job data for invalid inputs
5. Review the timeline to understand when the failure occurred

### Monitoring Active Jobs

- Long-running active jobs may indicate stuck workers
- Check the **Processed On** time for active jobs
- If a job has been active for too long, the worker may have crashed

### Cleaning Up Old Jobs

BullMQ has built-in job retention settings. Configure in your worker:

```javascript
const queue = new Queue('my-queue', {
  defaultJobOptions: {
    removeOnComplete: {
      age: 3600, // Keep for 1 hour
      count: 1000 // Keep last 1000
    },
    removeOnFail: {
      age: 86400 // Keep failed jobs for 24 hours
    }
  }
});
```
