The bullstudio dashboard provides comprehensive visibility into your queue operations with real-time metrics, charts, and insights.

## Overview

When you open a workspace, the dashboard displays key metrics for your selected connection and queue. Data updates automatically every 30 seconds, with a manual refresh option available.

## Metric Cards

The top of the dashboard displays six key metrics:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Total Completed** | Number of successfully processed jobs in the selected time range |
| **Total Failed** | Number of jobs that failed processing |
| **Throughput/Hour** | Average number of jobs completed per hour |
| **Failure Rate** | Percentage of failed jobs vs total processed |
| **Avg Processing Time** | Mean time to process a job (in milliseconds) |
| **Avg Delay** | Mean time jobs wait before processing starts |

<Tip>
  Use the time range selector to adjust the metrics window from 1 hour up to 7 days.
</Tip>

## Charts

### Throughput Chart

Visualizes job completion and failure rates over time:

- **Completed** (green): Successfully processed jobs per hour
- **Failed** (red): Failed jobs per hour

Use this chart to:
- Identify peak processing times
- Spot sudden increases in failures
- Understand traffic patterns

### Processing Time Chart

Shows how job processing time changes over time:

- **Average**: Mean processing time per hour
- Helps identify performance degradation or improvements

<Info>
  Spikes in processing time may indicate worker issues, resource constraints, or unusually complex jobs.
</Info>

## Tables

### Slowest Jobs

Lists the top 10 slowest jobs by processing time:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Job Name** | The job type/name |
| **Queue** | Which queue the job belongs to |
| **Processing Time** | How long the job took to complete |
| **Timestamp** | When the job was processed |

Use this to identify performance bottlenecks and jobs that may need optimization.

### Failing Job Types

Shows the top 10 job types with the most failures:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Job Name** | The job type/name |
| **Queue** | Which queue the job belongs to |
| **Failure Count** | Number of failures in the time range |

This helps you prioritize which job handlers need debugging or improvement.

## Active Alerts

If you have alerts configured (Pro plan and above), the dashboard shows a summary of currently triggered alerts:

- Alert name and type
- Current status (Triggered or OK)
- Time since triggered

<Warning>
  Triggered alerts indicate potential issues that need attention. Click on an alert to view details and history.
</Warning>

## Filters

### Connection Selector

Choose which Redis connection to view metrics for. Each connection shows data from its connected Redis instance.

### Queue Selector

Filter metrics to a specific queue:

- **All Queues**: Aggregate metrics across all queues
- **Specific Queue**: Metrics for just that queue

### Time Range

Adjust the time window for all metrics and charts:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **1 hour** | Last 60 minutes |
| **6 hours** | Last 6 hours |
| **24 hours** | Last day (default) |
| **7 days** | Last week |

## Auto-Refresh

The dashboard automatically refreshes every 30 seconds. You can also:

- Click the **Refresh** button for immediate update
- See the "Last updated" timestamp

## Understanding Your Metrics

### Healthy Queue Indicators

- Failure rate below 1%
- Consistent throughput matching expected load
- Processing times within expected range
- No triggered alerts

### Warning Signs

- **Rising failure rate**: May indicate bugs, external service issues, or bad data
- **Increasing processing time**: Could signal resource constraints or inefficient code
- **High delay**: Queue may be backlogged, consider adding workers
- **Throughput drops**: Workers may be down or stuck
