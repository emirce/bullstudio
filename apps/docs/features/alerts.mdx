Alerts notify you when your queues experience issues like high failure rates, large backlogs, or slow processing. Stay informed about problems before they impact users.

<Info>
  Alerts are available on **Pro** and **Enterprise** plans. [Upgrade your plan](/platform/billing) to enable alerts.

## Alert Types

bullstudio supports six alert types to cover common queue monitoring scenarios:

### Failure Rate

Triggers when the percentage of failed jobs exceeds a threshold.

| Setting | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Threshold** | Failure rate percentage to trigger alert | 10% |
| **Time Window** | Period to calculate failure rate | 15 minutes |
| **Resolve Threshold** | Rate to resolve alert | 5% |

**Use case**: Detect when your workers are experiencing higher-than-normal error rates.

### Backlog Exceeded

Triggers when the number of waiting jobs exceeds a threshold.

| Setting | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Threshold** | Number of waiting jobs to trigger | 1000 |
| **Resolve Threshold** | Number to resolve alert | 500 |

**Use case**: Detect when jobs are piling up faster than workers can process them.

### Processing Time (Average)

Triggers when average job processing time exceeds a threshold.

| Setting | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Threshold** | Average time in milliseconds | 5000ms |
| **Time Window** | Period to calculate average | 10 minutes |
| **Resolve Threshold** | Time to resolve alert | 3000ms |

**Use case**: Detect when jobs are taking longer than expected to process.

### Processing Time (P95)

Triggers when the 95th percentile processing time exceeds a threshold.

| Setting | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Threshold** | P95 time in milliseconds | 10000ms |
| **Time Window** | Period to calculate P95 | 10 minutes |
| **Resolve Threshold** | Time to resolve alert | 7000ms |

**Use case**: Detect outlier slow jobs that may indicate specific issues.

### Processing Time (P99)

Triggers when the 99th percentile processing time exceeds a threshold.

| Setting | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Threshold** | P99 time in milliseconds | 30000ms |
| **Time Window** | Period to calculate P99 | 10 minutes |
| **Resolve Threshold** | Time to resolve alert | 20000ms |

**Use case**: Catch the slowest jobs that may timeout or cause problems.

### Missing Workers

Triggers when no workers have processed jobs for a specified period.

| Setting | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Grace Period** | Time with no activity before alerting | 5 minutes |

**Use case**: Detect when all workers have crashed or stopped.

## Alert Statuses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **OK** | Conditions are within normal thresholds |
| **Triggered** | Threshold exceeded, notification sent |

## Creating an Alert

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Alerts">
    Go to your workspace and click **Alerts** in the sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Create Alert">
    Click the **Create Alert** button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the alert">
    Fill in the alert configuration:

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | **Name** | Descriptive name for the alert |
    | **Description** | Optional details about what this alert monitors |
    | **Connection** | Which Redis connection to monitor |
    | **Queue** | Which queue to monitor (or all queues) |
    | **Alert Type** | Select from the available types |
    | **Configuration** | Type-specific thresholds |
    | **Recipients** | Email addresses for notifications |
    | **Cooldown** | Minimum time between notifications |
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save** to create the alert. It will start monitoring immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Alert Configuration

### Thresholds

Set appropriate thresholds based on your normal operating parameters:

```
Normal failure rate: ~1%
→ Alert threshold: 5%
→ Resolve threshold: 2%

Normal processing time: ~500ms
→ Alert threshold: 2000ms
→ Resolve threshold: 1000ms
```

<Tip>
  Start with higher thresholds and adjust down as you understand your baseline metrics.
</Tip>

### Time Windows

Time windows determine how data is aggregated:

- **Shorter windows** (5-10 min): More responsive, may be noisy
- **Longer windows** (30-60 min): Smoother, may miss brief spikes

### Cooldown Period

The cooldown prevents alert fatigue:

- Minimum: 1 minute
- Maximum: 24 hours (1440 minutes)
- Default: 15 minutes

During cooldown, no new notifications are sent even if the alert remains triggered.

### Recipients

Add one or more email addresses to receive notifications:

- Notifications sent when alert triggers
- Resolution notifications sent when alert returns to OK

## Managing Alerts

### Edit Alert

1. Click on the alert in the list
2. Click **Edit**
3. Modify settings
4. Click **Save**

### Enable/Disable Alert

Toggle an alert without deleting it:

1. Click on the alert
2. Toggle the **Enabled** switch
3. Disabled alerts don't evaluate or send notifications

### Delete Alert

1. Click on the alert
2. Click **Delete**
3. Confirm deletion

<Warning>
  Deleting an alert removes all its history. Consider disabling instead if you may need it later.
</Warning>

### Test Alert

Send a test notification to verify your configuration:

1. Click on the alert
2. Click **Test**
3. A test notification will be sent to all recipients

## Viewing Alert History

Each alert maintains a history of triggers:

- When the alert was triggered
- When it was resolved
- Duration of the incident

Use this to:
- Identify patterns in issues
- Track incident frequency
- Measure improvement over time

## Alert Best Practices

### Start with Essential Alerts

Begin with these core alerts for most queues:

1. **Failure Rate**: Catch bugs and external service issues
2. **Backlog Exceeded**: Detect capacity problems
3. **Missing Workers**: Know when workers are down

### Set Meaningful Thresholds

Base thresholds on your actual metrics:

```
1. Review your dashboard for normal values
2. Set threshold at 2-3x normal
3. Set resolve threshold at 1.5x normal
4. Adjust based on false positives/negatives
```

### Use Appropriate Time Windows

| Scenario | Recommended Window |
|----------|-------------------|
| High-volume queues (1000+ jobs/hour) | 5-10 minutes |
| Medium-volume queues (100-1000/hour) | 15-30 minutes |
| Low-volume queues (&lt;100/hour) | 30-60 minutes |

### Avoid Alert Fatigue

- Use resolve thresholds to prevent flapping
- Set reasonable cooldown periods
- Start with fewer, broader alerts
- Refine over time based on actual incidents

## Notification Content

Alert notifications include:

- Alert name and type
- Queue and connection name
- Current metric value vs threshold
- Link to the alert in bullstudio
- Timestamp
