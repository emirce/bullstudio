AI coding assistants can help you integrate BullMQ queues with bullstudio more efficiently. This section provides configuration guides for popular AI tools.

## Why Use AI Assistants?

AI assistants can help with:

- **Worker code**: Generate BullMQ worker implementations
- **Queue setup**: Configure queues with proper options
- **Error handling**: Add retry logic and error handling
- **Troubleshooting**: Debug queue and job issues
- **Documentation**: Understand bullstudio features

## Common Use Cases

### Creating BullMQ Workers

Ask your AI assistant to help create workers:

```
Create a BullMQ worker for processing email notifications that:
- Connects to Redis with TLS
- Has proper error handling
- Reports job progress
- Uses exponential backoff for retries
```

### Debugging Failed Jobs

When investigating issues:

```
This job is failing with "SMTP connection refused".
The job data is: { userId: "123", email: "user@example.com" }
Help me add proper error handling and retry logic.
```

### Setting Up Alerts

Get help configuring alerts:

```
What failure rate threshold should I use for a payment
processing queue that normally has a 0.3% failure rate?
```

## Best Practices

When using AI assistants with bullstudio:

1. **Provide context**: Share your queue names, job types, and current issues
2. **Include error messages**: Copy full stack traces for debugging
3. **Mention your setup**: Note if using proxy agent vs direct connection
4. **Ask for explanations**: Understanding helps you maintain the code
