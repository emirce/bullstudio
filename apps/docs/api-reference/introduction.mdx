<Info>
  The bullstudio REST API is currently in development. This page will be updated when the API becomes available.
</Info>

## Coming Soon

We're working on a comprehensive REST API that will allow you to:

- **Manage Connections**: Create, update, and delete Redis connections programmatically
- **Query Jobs**: List and filter jobs, retrieve job details, retry or remove jobs
- **Control Queues**: Pause and resume queues, get queue statistics
- **Configure Alerts**: Create and manage alerts via API
- **Access Metrics**: Retrieve queue metrics and analytics data

## Current Integration Options

While the REST API is in development, you can integrate with bullstudio using:

### Direct Connection

For publicly accessible Redis instances, use [direct connections](/getting-started/connection/direct-connection) through the bullstudio dashboard. This allows bullstudio to connect directly to your cloud-hosted Redis services.

## API Design Preview

When released, the API will follow these principles:

- **RESTful Design**: Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- **JSON Format**: All requests and responses use JSON
- **Bearer Authentication**: Secure API key authentication
- **Rate Limiting**: Fair usage limits per plan
- **Pagination**: Efficient handling of large datasets
