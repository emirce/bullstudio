Follow these steps to start monitoring your BullMQ queues with bullstudio.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A Redis instance with BullMQ queues
- Network access to your Redis instance (must be publicly accessible)

## Step 1: Create Your Account

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign up">
    Go to [app.bullstudio.dev](https://app.bullstudio.dev) and create an account using your email or GitHub.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an organization">
    After signing up, you'll be prompted to create an organization. This is the top-level container for your workspaces and billing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Set Up a Workspace

Workspaces help you organize your Redis connections by environment (development, staging, production) or project.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to workspaces">
    From your organization dashboard, click **Create Workspace**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name your workspace">
    Enter a descriptive name like "Production" or "Development". The slug will be auto-generated.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Use separate workspaces for each environment to keep your connections organized and prevent accidental operations on production queues.
</Tip>

## Step 3: Connect to Redis

Connect bullstudio to your publicly accessible Redis instance:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Connections">
    Go to **Connections** in your workspace sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a new connection">
    Click **Add Connection** and select **Direct Redis**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter connection details">
    Fill in your Redis connection information:
    - **Host**: Your Redis hostname (e.g., `redis.example.com`)
    - **Port**: Redis port (default: `6379`)
    - **Password**: Your Redis password (if required)
    - **TLS**: Enable for secure connections (recommended)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test and save">
    Click **Test Connection** to verify, then click **Save**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Always use TLS when connecting to Redis over the public internet.
</Warning>

## Step 4: View Your Queues

Once connected, bullstudio automatically discovers your BullMQ queues.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Dashboard">
    Select your connection from the dropdown to see queue metrics.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Browse Jobs">
    Navigate to **Jobs** to view and filter jobs by status, queue, and name.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Alerts (Pro)">
    Go to **Alerts** to configure notifications for queue issues.
  </Step>
</Steps>
