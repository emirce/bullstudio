Organizations are the top-level container in bullstudio. They hold your workspaces, team members, and billing information.

## What is an Organization?

An organization represents your company, team, or project. It contains:

- **Workspaces**: Grouped Redis connections
- **Members**: Team members with access
- **Subscription**: Your billing plan and limits

## Organization Structure

```
Organization (My Company)
├── Members
│   └── you@example.com (Owner)
├── Subscription (Pro Plan)
└── Workspaces
    ├── Production
    │   ├── Connection: prod-redis
    │   └── Alerts: failure-rate, backlog
    ├── Staging
    │   └── Connection: staging-redis
    └── Development
        └── Connection: dev-redis
```

## Organization Limits

Limits are determined by your subscription plan:

| Feature | Free | Pro | Enterprise |
|---------|------|-----|------------|
| Workspaces | 1 | 5 | 10 |
| Connections (per workspace) | 1 | 5 | 10 |
| Alerts | No | Yes | Yes |
| Members | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited |

## Best Practices

### One Organization per Company

Keep all your company's workspaces under one organization for:

- Unified billing
- Easy team management
- Consistent access control

### Use Workspaces for Environments

Instead of multiple organizations, use workspaces to separate environments:

```
Organization: Acme Corp
├── Workspace: Production
├── Workspace: Staging
└── Workspace: Development
```
