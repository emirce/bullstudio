Workspaces help you organize your Redis connections and keep different environments separate. Each workspace contains its own connections, alerts, and settings.

## What is a Workspace?

A workspace is a container within an organization that groups related Redis connections together. Common use cases:

- **By environment**: Development, Staging, Production
- **By project**: Project A, Project B
- **By team**: Backend Team, Data Pipeline Team

## Creating a Workspace

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to your organization">
    Select your organization from the sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Create Workspace">
    Click the **Create Workspace** button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter workspace details">
    | Field | Description | Example |
    |-------|-------------|---------|
    | **Name** | Display name for the workspace | Production |
    | **Slug** | URL-friendly identifier (auto-generated) | production |
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Create** to create the workspace.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Slugs can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. They must be unique within your organization.
</Info>

## Workspace Limits

The number of workspaces you can create depends on your subscription plan:

| Plan | Workspaces |
|------|------------|
| Free | 1 |
| Pro | 5 |
| Enterprise | 10 |

<Tip>
  Need more workspaces? [Contact us](mailto:support@bullstudio.dev) about Enterprise options.
</Tip>

## Workspace Contents

Each workspace contains:

### Redis Connections

Connect to one or more Redis instances within a workspace. See [Connection Overview](/getting-started/connection/overview) for setup instructions.

| Plan | Connections per Workspace |
|------|--------------------------|
| Free | 1 |
| Pro | 5 |
| Enterprise | 10 |

### Alerts

Configure alerts for queues within the workspace. Alerts are scoped to a specific connection and queue.

<Info>
  Alerts require a Pro or Enterprise plan.
</Info>

## Workspace Settings

### Rename Workspace

1. Go to the workspace
2. Click **Settings** in the sidebar
3. Update the **Name** field
4. Click **Save**

### Change Slug

1. Go to workspace **Settings**
2. Update the **Slug** field
3. Click **Save**

<Warning>
  Changing the slug will change all URLs for the workspace. Update any bookmarks or shared links.
</Warning>

### Delete Workspace

1. Go to workspace **Settings**
2. Click **Delete Workspace**
3. Type the workspace name to confirm
4. Click **Delete**

<Warning>
  Deleting a workspace permanently removes all connections and alerts. This action cannot be undone.
</Warning>

## Workspace Members

Workspace access is inherited from organization membership. All organization members can access all workspaces within that organization.

### Member Roles

| Role | Permissions |
|------|------------|
| **Owner** | Full access: manage connections, alerts, settings, delete workspace |
| **Member** | View and interact: view queues and jobs, retry/remove jobs (if read-write) |

## Best Practices

### Environment Separation

Create separate workspaces for each environment:

```
Organization: My Company
├── Workspace: Development
│   └── Connection: localhost Redis
├── Workspace: Staging
│   └── Connection: staging.redis.example.com
└── Workspace: Production
    └── Connection: prod.redis.example.com
```

<Warning>
  Keep production and development separate to prevent accidental operations on production queues.
</Warning>

### Consistent Naming

Use clear, consistent naming conventions:

| Good | Avoid |
|------|-------|
| `production` | `prod` |
| `staging` | `stg` |
| `development` | `dev-1` |
| `project-api` | `api` |

### Use Read-Only for Production

When setting up production connections, consider using Read-Only access mode to prevent accidental job modifications.

## Switching Workspaces

To switch between workspaces:

1. Click the workspace name in the sidebar
2. Select a different workspace from the dropdown
3. Or use the organization dashboard to see all workspaces
