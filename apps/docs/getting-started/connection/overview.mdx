bullstudio needs to connect to your Redis instance to read BullMQ queue data.

## Direct Connection

Connect directly to a publicly accessible Redis instance. This is the recommended method for cloud-hosted Redis services like AWS ElastiCache, Redis Cloud, Upstash, and Railway.

  Connect directly to a publicly accessible Redis instance with TLS encryption.

## Requirements

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Public accessibility** | Redis must be reachable over the internet |
| **TLS encryption** | Strongly recommended for secure connections |
| **Authentication** | Password or Redis 6+ ACL credentials |

## Security Considerations

<Warning>
  Never expose Redis to the public internet without authentication and TLS encryption.
</Warning>

### Best Practices

- **Always enable TLS** when connecting over the internet
- Use **strong passwords** or Redis 6+ ACL authentication
- Consider **IP allowlisting** if your provider supports it
- Use **Read-Only** access mode if you don't need write operations

## Connection Limits

The number of connections you can create depends on your subscription plan:

| Plan | Connections per Workspace |
|------|--------------------------|
| Free | 1 |
| Pro | 5 |
| Enterprise | 10 |
